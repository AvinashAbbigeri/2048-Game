2048 Game Clone

Brief Overview:
- A web-based implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game where players slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to merge them and create tiles with a 
  value of 2048 or higher. The game includes animations, score tracking, and high-score persistence for an engaging user experience.

Key Features:
- Dynamic 4x4 grid that updates in real-time with player moves.
-	Smooth animations for tile merging and new tile placement.
-	Score tracking with high-score persistence using localStorage.
-	Game Over detection when no valid moves are available.
-	Restart functionality to reset the board while maintaining the high score.

Technologies Used:
- HTML: For structuring the game grid and user interface.
- CSS: To style the game, including animations and responsive design.
- JavaScript: For implementing game logic, tile interactions, and event handling.

My Role:
- Designed the game interface and grid layout using HTML and CSS.
- Developed the core logic for tile movement, merging, and random tile generation in JavaScript.
- Implemented persistent high-score tracking using the localStorage API.
- Added animations for a visually appealing and smooth user experience.

Challenges Solved:
- Handling tile merging and ensuring correct placement during moves in all four directions.
- Synchronizing animations with grid updates for seamless transitions.
- Efficiently checking for possible moves and empty tiles to detect game-over conditions.

Outcome:
- The project serves as a functional and visually appealing version of the classic 2048 game. It provides players with a fun and interactive 
  experience, showcasing strong skills in JavaScript and front-end development.
